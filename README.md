# TODOWEBAPP
This code is for a basic to-do list application. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.
1.HTML Structure: We start with the HTML structure. There's a title, a header with the app name, and a section for the to-do list.
2.Input and Button: In the "list-head" section, there's an input field where users can type their tasks and a button labeled "ADD" to add the task.
3.Tasks Container: Below that, there's an empty container called "tasks" where we will display the tasks as they are added.
4.JavaScript Integration: At the end of the HTML file, we include our JavaScript code using a <script> tag. This code interacts with the HTML elements to make the app work.
5.Event Listeners: We add event listeners to the input field and the "ADD" button.
6.When a user types something in the input field, the "ADD" button becomes active.
Clicking the "ADD" button adds the task to the list, and the input field is cleared.
7.Task Items: Each task is represented as a "div" element with a task description and two icons: a pencil for editing and a square-xmark for deleting.
8.Edit and Delete: Users can click the pencil icon to mark a task as completed or uncompleted. Clicking the square-xmark icon deletes the task.

That's the basic idea. Users enter tasks, click "ADD" to add them to the list, can mark them as completed, and delete them when done. It's a simple to-do list app.
